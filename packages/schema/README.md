**AeroGraphQL** is an opinionated [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/index.html) framework to create [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/learn/) server using a declarative approach.

# AeroGraphQL Schema

Define your [GraphQL schema](http://graphql.org/learn/schema/) using Typesctipt annotations and intergrate seamlessly your [GraphQL resolvers](http://graphql.org/learn/execution/) using those same types, directly in Typescript.

Then plug the GraphQL schema in any GraphQL server you want !
